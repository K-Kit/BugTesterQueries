# Bug Tester Queries

## Setup
1) Clone the repository
2) docker-compose build
3) docker-compose up

## Usage

- Visit localhost:5000/ to view a very simple web interface to query bug testers by country and devices.

- Visit localhost:/graphql for view GraphiQl


Notes: web interface was somewhat of an afterthought and is not get included in the docker, I have included a built version of the react app to simplify things
